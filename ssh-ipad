After installing/enabling OpenSSH, here are some simple steps to get started:

1.) Right Click on your Windows Start Button (or press Windows Key + X) and open Command Prompt (or Windows Powershell).

2.) On your iOS Device, Open Settings and go to WiFi > Wifi Info ('i' next to your current WiFi Network) and Copy your IP Address.

3.) In your Command Prompt window, type "ssh root@<Your IP Address>" without quotes. You will be then prompted to accept. Just type "yes" and press Enter.

4.) You will then be prompted for the password. Type the default password which is alpine (unless it was of course, changed).


ssh root@Your IP Address
# pass  "alpine"
